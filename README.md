LEGO Models
===============================================================================

Intro
-----

This repository contains a bunch of Lego models (mostly official ones) that I
have and have built and/or animated.

The LXF models are for the most part NOT my own work and have been found on the
web. I do not pretend any ownership and they are only kept here for convenience and in case I need to make alterations for the purpose of animation.

Some of the models have been lit / animated and this repository contains any electronics designs (schematics, PCBs) and firmware used for the job.
